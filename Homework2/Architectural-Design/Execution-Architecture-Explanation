Our web application communicates with all the services of the program through an established HTTP connection by the user.
The information, which includes: Account Information and preferences, as well as the Route and Travel time to the parking place,
the prices and their location is all fetched from a database,
which is then brought back to the AppUI, all done asynchronously.
